# Coding in markdown?

You can also use markdown to simply code! For the smoothness you will need to install the `knitr` R package as well a some packages on your text editor (`knitr` as well in Sublime).

## For example

Here's a really complex example

```{r}
## What's the result of this?
1 + 1

## Or of that?
mean(c(1,1,1,1))

```

Sweet eh?

## But you can also do some graphs of course!


```{r, fig.width=6, fig.height=6}
plot(1)
```

Or more fancy:

```{r, fig.width=6, fig.height=6}
## Pretty example from graphics::image manual
x <- y <- seq(-4*pi, 4*pi, len = 27)
r <- sqrt(outer(x^2, y^2, "+"))
image(z = z <- cos(r^2)*exp(-r/6), col  = gray((0:32)/32))
image(z, axes = FALSE, main = "Math can be beautiful ...",
      xlab = expression(cos(r^2) * e^{-r/6}))
contour(z, add = TRUE, drawlabels = FALSE)
```
